            <p>
                In my Master's degree in GIS, I gained comprehensive knowledge of GIS Analysis, geocomputing (Big Data and Machine Learning), spatial database design, and cartography design. 
                Building on my engineering problem-solving skills and the professional knowledge gained from my work experience and undergraduate courses, 
                I developed a strong aptitude for applying GIS tools to solve complex spatial problems. 
                This program deepened my understanding of the technical and analytical aspects of GIS and allowed me to explore new areas of interest in this dynamic field. 
                With this knowledge, I am well-equipped to tackle real-world challenges and make meaningful contributions to the GIS and spatial data community.

                            The map is created using Folium, while data analysis is carried out using geospatial packages such as pandas and geopandas.
                            Additionally, OSMnx and NetworkX are utilized to calculate and display the shortest path. 
                            Furthermore, Matplotlib and Shapely are used to highlight important areas relevant to the ongoing discussion between the Metro Transit company and the local community.

                        <p>
                            This project is a GIS analysis project that evaluates the environmental impact of road salt use in the metropolitan area of Marathon County.
                            It was referred by the course instructor and UniverCity Alliance, the project involved several steps of spatial data analysis and visualization.
                            Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in applying GIS technology to solve real-world problems.

                        <p>
                            This project is a task in a GIS analysis course that involves mapping the current situation of bank branches and examining the correlation between customer demographic trends and branch performance.
                            Ultimately, we need to provide recommendations on whether to close existing branches or open new ones based on the analysis results.

                        <h3>Public Transportation Infrastructure in Taiwan</h3>
                        <p>
                            This map is the final project map in the Cartograpy design course.
                            I utilized both ArcGIS Pro and Adobe Illustrator to create a map showing the public transportation infrastructure in Taiwan.
                            It allows the visitors to swiftly and effectively understand which counties or cities are more visitor-friendly in terms of accessible public transportation options, 
                            catering specifically to those who prefer relying on local services rather than renting a car.
